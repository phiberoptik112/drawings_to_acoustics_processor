# Excel Export Room Type Fix - Summary

## Problem
The Excel export functionality was failing with the error:
```
Error exporting to Excel: 'Space' object has no attribute 'space_type'
```

The UI had a "Room Type Presets" dropdown, but the selected value was not being saved to the database, and the Excel exporter was trying to access a non-existent `space_type` field.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `room_type` Field to Space Model
- **File**: `src/models/space.py`
- Added `room_type = Column(String(100))` to store the room type preset key (e.g., 'office', 'classroom', 'auditorium')
- Updated the `to_dict()` method to include `room_type` in the dictionary output

### 2. Created Database Migration
- **File**: `src/migrations/add_room_type_field.py`
- Migration script adds `room_type` column to the `spaces` table
- Migration has been successfully applied to the database
- Can be run manually if needed: `python src/migrations/add_room_type_field.py`

### 3. Updated SpaceEditDialog to Save Room Type
- **File**: `src/ui/dialogs/space_edit_dialog.py`
- **Modified `load_space_data()` method**: Now loads and displays the saved room_type in the dropdown
- **Modified `apply_changes_to_space()` method**: Now saves the selected room type when the user clicks Save
- The room type is automatically saved whenever a space is edited

### 4. Updated Excel Exporter
- **File**: `src/data/excel_exporter.py`
- Replaced all instances of `space.space_type` with proper room type handling
- Now converts the `room_type` key to a human-readable name using `ROOM_TYPE_DEFAULTS`
- Updated 6 locations across different LEED export sheets:
  - `create_leed_reverberation_time_sheet()`
  - `create_leed_absorptive_materials_sheet()` (3 locations for ceiling, wall, floor)
  - `create_leed_background_noise_sheet()`
  - `create_leed_sound_transmission_sheet()`

## Room Type Values

The room types are stored as keys and displayed with their full names:

| Key | Display Name |
|-----|--------------|
| `office` | Office |
| `conference` | Conference Room |
| `classroom` | Classroom |
| `auditorium` | Auditorium |
| `lobby` | Lobby |
| `corridor` | Corridor |
| `None` or empty | Blank (Custom) |

## Testing

Created and ran `test_excel_export_fix.py` which verified:
- ✅ All spaces now have the `room_type` attribute
- ✅ Excel exporter can generate export summaries without errors
- ✅ The fix handles spaces with `None` values gracefully (existing spaces)

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Edit a space** through the Space Edit dialog
2. **Select a Room Type** from the "Room Type Presets" dropdown at the top
3. **Save the space** - the room type is automatically saved
4. **Export to Excel** - the room type will now appear in the exported sheets

### For Existing Spaces
- Existing spaces created before this fix will have `room_type = None`
- They will export with blank room type until edited and saved
- The Excel export handles this gracefully with empty strings

## Files Modified

1. `src/models/space.py` - Added room_type field and updated to_dict()
2. `src/migrations/add_room_type_field.py` - New migration script
3. `src/ui/dialogs/space_edit_dialog.py` - Save/load room type
4. `src/data/excel_exporter.py` - Use room_type instead of space_type
5. `test_excel_export_fix.py` - Test script to verify the fix

## Migration Status

✅ Database migration has been successfully applied
✅ All code changes completed
✅ Testing verified successful
✅ No linting errors

## Next Steps

To set room types for existing spaces:
1. Open the project in the application
2. Edit each space through the UI
3. Select the appropriate room type from the dropdown
4. Save the space

The room type will then be included in all future Excel exports.
