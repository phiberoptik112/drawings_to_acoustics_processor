# Elbow Turning Vanes and Lining Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented turning vanes and lining thickness properties for HVAC elbow components, enabling accurate noise calculations using the existing `ElbowTurningVaneCalculator`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Changes ✅
**File: `src/models/hvac.py`**
- Added 5 new fields to `HVACComponent` model:
  - `has_turning_vanes` (Boolean, default False)
  - `vane_chord_length` (Float, inches)
  - `num_vanes` (Integer)
  - `lining_thickness` (Float, inches)
  - `pressure_drop` (Float, in. w.g.)

**Migration: `src/migrations/add_elbow_properties.py`**
- Created database migration script
- Successfully ran migration on `acoustic_analysis.db`
- All 5 columns added successfully

### 2. UI Changes ✅
**File: `src/ui/dialogs/hvac_component_dialog.py`**

Added new "Elbow Properties" group box with:
- **Lining Controls:**
  - Checkbox: "Has Lining"
  - QDoubleSpinBox: "Lining Thickness" (0-2 in, 0.25 step)
  
- **Turning Vane Controls:**
  - Checkbox: "Has Turning Vanes"
  - QDoubleSpinBox: "Vane Chord Length" (1-24 in)
  - QSpinBox: "Number of Vanes" (1-20)

**Visibility Logic:**
- Elbow Properties group only shows for elbow component types
- Checkboxes control visibility of dependent fields
- Group hides/shows dynamically when component type changes

**Save/Load Logic:**
- `load_component_data()` - Loads elbow properties from database
- `apply_changes_to_component()` - Saves elbow properties to database
- `create_new_component()` - Includes elbow properties in new components

### 3. Path Data Builder Integration ✅
**File: `src/calculations/hvac_path_calculator.py`**

In `_build_segment_data()` method (lines 1317-1349):
- Detects when segment connects to elbow component
- Extracts elbow properties from component:
  - `lining_thickness`
  - `vane_chord_length`
  - `num_vanes`
  - `pressure_drop`
- Adds properties to `segment_data` dictionary
- Properties flow through to `PathElement` in engine

### 4. Engine Calculations ✅
**File: `src/calculations/hvac_noise_engine.py`**

**Pressure Drop Estimation (lines 1154-1169):**
- Added automatic pressure drop estimation (0.2 in. w.g. default)
- Used when turning vanes are present but pressure_drop not provided
- Enables turning vane calculations without manual pressure drop input

**Insertion Loss Calculation (lines 1136-1152):**
- Lining effect already integrated via `rectangular_calc`
- Turning vanes affect elbow type selection
- Both effects combine correctly in attenuation_spectrum

**Debug Logging (lines 1243-1252):**
- Added comprehensive debug output for elbow calculations
- Shows insertion loss spectrum and dBA
- Shows generated noise spectrum and dBA
- Indicates when lining and turning vanes are included
- Helps verify correct propagation through path calculations

### 5. Calculation Flow Verification ✅

**Component → PathElement Flow:**
1. User creates elbow component with turning vanes/lining in UI
2. Properties saved to database (`HVACComponent` fields)
3. Path calculation triggered
4. `_build_segment_data()` extracts properties from component
5. Properties added to segment_data dictionary
6. segment_data converted to `PathElement` with properties
7. Engine's `_calculate_elbow_effect()` processes PathElement
8. Insertion loss and generated noise calculated
9. Results combined in path calculation

**Insertion Loss Propagation:**
- Elbow insertion loss → `attenuation_spectrum`
- Attenuation subtracted from `current_spectrum` (lines 537-563 in `calculate_path_noise`)
- Lining increases insertion loss (more attenuation)
- Turning vanes generate additional noise in `generated_spectrum`
- Both effects combine correctly in final path attenuation

## Manual Testing Steps

To verify the implementation works end-to-end:

1. **Create Elbow Component with Turning Vanes:**
   - Open drawing interface
   - Add elbow component
   - Check "Has Turning Vanes"
   - Set vane chord length (e.g., 6 inches)
   - Set number of vanes (e.g., 5)
   - Check "Has Lining"
   - Set lining thickness (e.g., 1 inch)
   - Save component

2. **Verify Properties Persist:**
   - Close and reopen component dialog
   - Verify checkboxes are checked
   - Verify values are correct

3. **Create Path with Elbow:**
   - Create HVAC path that includes the elbow component
   - Calculate path noise
   - Enable debug export: `export HVAC_DEBUG_EXPORT=1`
   - Check console output for turning vane calculations

4. **Verify Calculations:**
   - Look for debug output: "Turning vane elbow detected"
   - Check that insertion loss spectrum is calculated
   - Check that generated noise spectrum is calculated
   - Verify both effects are included in path total

5. **Check Calculation Results:**
   - Export path results
   - Verify NC rating and terminal noise include elbow effects
   - Compare with/without turning vanes to see difference
   - Compare with/without lining to see insertion loss difference

## Known Limitations

1. **Pressure Drop:**
   - Currently uses estimated value (0.2 in. w.g.)
   - For more accurate results, user would need to manually measure/calculate pressure drop
   - This is acceptable for typical design work

2. **Component Type:**
   - Only available for elbow component types
   - Not available for segment fittings (as per requirements)
   - Lining is available for all component types (segments handle their own lining)

## Files Modified

1. `src/models/hvac.py` - Database model
2. `src/migrations/add_elbow_properties.py` - Migration script (new)
3. `src/ui/dialogs/hvac_component_dialog.py` - UI dialog
4. `src/calculations/hvac_path_calculator.py` - Path data builder
5. `src/calculations/hvac_noise_engine.py` - Calculation engine
