## Development Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

**Installation Commands:**
```bash
# Quick setup test (no dependencies needed)
python test_structure.py

# Install all dependencies
python install_dev.py
# OR manually:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
cd src
python main.py
```

**Dependencies (requirements.txt):**
- PyQt5>=5.15.7 (GUI framework)
- SQLAlchemy>=1.4.0 (Database ORM)
- PyMuPDF>=1.21.0 (PDF processing - Phase 2)
- openpyxl>=3.0.10 (Excel export - Phase 4)
- numpy>=1.21.0, scipy>=1.7.0 (Calculations - Phase 4)

## Architecture Notes

**Database Structure (SQLAlchemy Models):**
- `Project`: Main project container with settings
- `Drawing`: PDF drawings with scale information  
- `Space`: Rooms/spaces for acoustic analysis with RT60 calculations
- `RoomBoundary`: Rectangle boundaries drawn on PDFs
- `HVACComponent`: Equipment placed on drawings (AHU, VAV, diffusers)
- `HVACPath`: Complete air paths from source to terminal
- `HVACSegment`: Individual duct segments between components
- `SegmentFitting`: Fittings within segments (elbows, tees, etc.)

**UI Structure:**
- `SplashScreen`: Project selection and creation
- `ProjectDashboard`: Main project management interface
- `DrawingInterface`: PDF viewer with drawing tools (Phase 2)
- `ProjectDialog`: New project creation dialog

**Standard Libraries:**
- 8 HVAC components with typical noise levels
- 17 acoustic materials with absorption coefficients
- 6 room type defaults for quick setup
- Standard duct sizes and fittings

## Commands

**Development:**
```bash
# Test project structure
python test_structure.py

# Install development environment
python install_dev.py

# Run application
cd src && python main.py

# Test database models (no PyQt5 needed)
python -c "from src.models import Project; print('Models working')"
```

**Application Usage:**
1. Start application: `python main.py` from src directory
2. Create new project or open existing
3. Project dashboard manages drawings, spaces, and HVAC paths
4. Import PDFs and draw room boundaries (Phase 2)
5. Place HVAC components and draw segments (Phase 3)
6. Calculate RT60 and noise levels (Phase 4-5)
7. Export results to Excel (Phase 6)

## Notes for Future Development

**Technical Approach:**
- Segment-based HVAC modeling for accurate path calculations
- Rectangle-based room definitions for simple area calculations
- Scale-accurate measurements from PDF coordinates
- Modular calculation engines (RT60, noise) for extensibility

**Key Files to Understand:**
- `src/main.py`: Application entry point
- `src/models/`: Database schema and relationships
- `src/ui/project_dashboard.py`: Main project interface
- `src/ui/drawing_interface.py`: PDF viewer and drawing tools
- `src/ui/dialogs/room_properties.py`: Room creation and material selection
- `src/drawing/`: PDF viewer, drawing tools, and scale management
- `src/calculations/`: RT60 and acoustic calculation engines
- `src/data/`: Standard component and materials libraries
- `prd.md`: Complete product requirements document

**Development Guidelines:**
- Follow existing PyQt5 patterns and styling
- Use SQLAlchemy session management (`get_session()`)
- Import standard libraries from `src/data/`
- Maintain segment-based approach for HVAC paths
- Keep rectangle-based approach for room boundaries
