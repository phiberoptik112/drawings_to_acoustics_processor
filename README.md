- Click **Remove** next to a material to unassign it
- Materials are saved with the space configuration

### Space Calculations

Once spaces are configured with geometry and materials, perform acoustic calculations.

#### RT60 Calculation Workflow

**Prerequisites:**
- Space has valid floor area and ceiling height
- At least one material assigned to each surface type
- Target RT60 value set (optional)

**Running Calculations:**
1. Open the space in Edit Space Properties dialog
2. Navigate to the **Calculations** tab
3. Click **Calculate RT60**
4. The system calculates:
   - Surface areas (floor, ceiling, walls from perimeter)
   - Total absorption from all assigned materials
   - RT60 using Sabine or Eyring formula
   - Comparison with target RT60 (if set)

**Results Display:**
```
Calculated RT60: 0.85 seconds
Target RT60: 0.80 seconds
Status: Within acceptable range ✅

Surface Breakdown:
- Floor: 425 sf | Carpet Tile | α = 0.35
- Ceiling: 425 sf | ACT Standard | α = 0.70
- Walls: 756 sf | Painted Drywall | α = 0.05
Total Absorption: 486.5 sabins
```

#### HVAC Noise Analysis Integration

Spaces can be linked to HVAC paths for mechanical background noise analysis.

**Workflow:**
1. Create HVAC paths terminating in the space
2. Configure path properties (duct sizes, fittings, etc.)
3. Run noise calculations
4. View NC rating in space properties

**Combined Analysis:**
The application provides both:
- **RT60**: Reverberation time for speech intelligibility
- **NC Rating**: Background noise level from HVAC systems

#### Interpreting Results

**RT60 Status Indicators:**
- ✅ **Green**: Calculated RT60 meets target
- ⚠️ **Yellow**: RT60 slightly outside target range
- ❌ **Red**: RT60 not calculated or significantly off target

**Noise Level Indicators:**
- 🔇 **Low**: NC < 30
- 🔉 **Moderate**: NC 30-40
- 🔊 **High**: NC 40-50
- 📢 **Very High**: NC > 50

**Target Comparisons:**
- Set target RT60 based on space type (LEED requirements)
- Compare calculated vs. target values
- Adjust materials if needed to meet targets
- Re-calculate after material changes

### Best Practices

- Keep material selections consistent across similar spaces

## Drawing Sets Organization

Drawing sets are a core organizational feature that helps manage multi-phase projects by grouping related elements.

### Purpose and Benefits

**Phase-Based Organization:**
- Group drawings by design phase (DD, SD, CD, Final, Legacy)
- Track project evolution from schematic through construction
- Enable systematic comparison between phases
- Maintain historical record of design changes

**Element Grouping:**
Drawing sets automatically organize:
- **Drawings**: PDF floor plans and mechanical drawings
- **Spaces**: Acoustic analysis rooms and areas
- **HVAC Paths**: Mechanical noise calculation paths

**Visual Organization in Dashboard:**
The Project Dashboard displays elements grouped by drawing set:
```
Drawing Sets
├─ 📁 Design Development (DD) - Active ✓
│  ├─ Drawings (3)
│  ├─ Spaces (8)
│  └─ HVAC Paths (12)
├─ 📁 Construction Documents (CD)
│  ├─ Drawings (4)
│  ├─ Spaces (12)
│  └─ HVAC Paths (15)
└─ 📁 No Drawing Set
   ├─ Spaces (2)
   └─ HVAC Paths (1)
```

### How Elements Are Assigned to Drawing Sets

**Automatic Assignment:**
- Spaces created from drawings inherit the drawing's drawing set
- HVAC paths placed on drawings inherit the drawing's drawing set
- Drawings are manually assigned to sets during import or via Project Settings

**Manual Assignment:**
- Spaces can be manually assigned to drawing sets via properties dialog
- HVAC paths can be reassigned between drawing sets
- Drawings can be moved between sets in Project Settings

**No Drawing Set Category:**
Elements without a drawing set assignment appear in the "No Drawing Set" category, which ensures all project elements are visible.

### Working Across Drawing Sets

**Active Drawing Set:**
- Only one drawing set is "active" at any time
- New drawings default to the active set
- Active set indicated with ✓ checkmark in dashboard
- Change active set via Project Settings

**Cross-Set Comparisons:**
- Compare drawings between different sets
- Track how spaces changed between design phases
- Analyze acoustic impact of design modifications
- Generate change reports for documentation

**Version Control Benefits:**
- Maintain complete project history
- Reference earlier design decisions
- Document evolution of acoustic solutions
- Support value engineering analysis

### Best Practices for Drawing Set Management

1. **Create Sets Early**: Set up drawing sets at project start
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use clear phase names (DD-Phase1, CD-Final, etc.)
3. **One Active Set**: Keep only current working phase active
4. **Regular Updates**: Create new sets for major revisions
5. **Archive Old Phases**: Use "Legacy" type for completed phases
6. **Document Changes**: Add descriptions explaining phase differences
