# Junction and Elbow Generated Noise Calculations

## Overview

This implementation provides comprehensive calculations for junction and elbow generated noise based on **ASHRAE 1991 Algorithms for HVAC Acoustics**. The calculations predict regenerated sound power levels in branch ducts associated with air flowing in duct turns and junctions.

## Applicable Configurations

The calculations apply to:
- 90° elbows without turning vanes
- X-junctions
- T-junctions  
- 90° branch takeoffs

## Equations Implemented

### Main Equation (4.13)
```
L_w(fo)_b = L_b(fo) + Dr + DT
```
Where:
- `L_w(fo)_b` = Total branch sound power level (dB)
- `L_b(fo)` = Base branch sound power level (dB)
- `Dr` = Rounding correction (dB)
- `DT` = Turbulence correction (dB)

### Branch Sound Power Level (4.14)
```
L_b(fo) = K_J + 10*log10(f/41) + 50*log10(U_B) + 10*log10(S_B) + 10*log10(D_B)
```
Where:
- `K_J` = Characteristic spectrum
- `f` = Frequency (Hz)
- `U_B` = Branch duct flow velocity (ft/s)
- `S_B` = Branch duct cross-sectional area (ft²)
- `D_B` = Branch duct equivalent diameter (ft)

### Equivalent Diameter for Rectangular Ducts (4.15)
```
D_B = (4*S_B/π)^0.5
```

### Flow Velocity (4.16)
```
U_B = Q_B/(S_B*60)
```
Where `Q_B` = Volume flow rate (ft³/min)

### Rounding Correction (4.17)
```
Dr = (1.0 - RD/0.13) * (6.793 - 1.86*log10(S_t))
```

### Rounding Parameter (4.18)
```
RD = R/(12*D_B)
```
Where `R` = Radius of bend or elbow (inches)

### Strouhal Number (4.19)
```
S_t = f*D_B/U_B
```

### Turbulence Correction (4.20)
```
DT = -1.667 + 1.8*m - 0.133*m²
```

### Velocity Ratio (4.21)
```
m = U_M/U_B
```

### Characteristic Spectrum (4.22)
```
K_J = -21.6 + 12.388*m^0.4751 - 16.482*m^(-0.3071)*log10(S_t) - 5.047*m^(-0.2372)*(log10(S_t))²
```

### Main Duct Sound Power Levels

#### X-Junction (4.23)
```
L_w(fo)_m = L_w(fo)_b + 20*log10(D_M/D_B) + 3
```

#### T-Junction (4.24)
```
L_w(fo)_m = L_w(fo)_b + 3
```

#### 90° Elbow without Turning Vanes (4.25)
```
L_w(fo)_m = L_w(fo)_b
```

#### 90° Branch Takeoff (4.26)
```
L_w(fo)_m = L_w(fo)_b + 20*log10(D_M/D_B)
```
