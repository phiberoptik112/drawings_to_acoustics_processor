# Non-Modal Edit Space Properties Dialog

## Overview

The Edit Space Properties dialog has been converted from a modal dialog to a non-modal (independent) window. This allows users to interact with other windows while editing space properties, enabling workflows such as:

- Viewing PDF drawing specifications side-by-side with the space editor
- Referencing other documents while adjusting room treatments
- Working with multiple space editing windows simultaneously
- Switching between the main application and the space editor freely

## Changes Made

### 1. SpaceEditDialog (`src/ui/dialogs/space_edit_dialog.py`)

**Key Changes:**
- Changed `setModal(True)` to `setModal(False)` to make the dialog non-modal
- Added `Qt.Window` flag to make it behave as an independent window
- Added `space_updated` signal to notify parent when changes are saved
- Modified `save_changes()` to emit the signal after successful save

**Signal:**
```python
space_updated = Signal()
```

This signal is emitted whenever the user clicks "Save Changes" or "Save and Close" and the save operation is successful.

### 2. ProjectDashboard (`src/ui/project_dashboard.py`)

**Key Changes:**
- Added `space_edit_dialogs` list to store references to open dialogs (prevents garbage collection)
- Changed from using `dialog.exec()` (modal) to `dialog.show()` (non-modal)
- Added `on_space_updated()` method to handle UI refresh when space is saved
- Added `on_space_dialog_closed()` method to clean up dialog references
- Connected dialog signals for proper lifecycle management

**Dialog Lifecycle:**
1. Dialog is created and shown with `show()` instead of `exec()`
2. Dialog reference is stored in `space_edit_dialogs` list
3. When user saves changes, `space_updated` signal triggers UI refresh
4. When dialog closes, `finished` signal triggers cleanup

## User Experience

### Before (Modal)
- User clicks "Edit Space"
- Dialog opens and blocks all other windows
- User must close dialog to interact with anything else
- Cannot reference external documents while editing

### After (Non-Modal)
- User clicks "Edit Space"
- Dialog opens as independent window
- User can interact with main application, open PDFs, etc.
- Dialog can be positioned side-by-side with reference documents
- Multiple dialogs can be open simultaneously (one per space)
- Changes are saved immediately and UI updates automatically

## Testing

A test script is provided to verify the non-modal behavior:

```bash
python test_non_modal_space_dialog.py
```

The test demonstrates:
1. Opening the Edit Space Properties dialog
2. Interacting with the main window while dialog is open
3. Typing in both windows simultaneously
4. Arranging windows side-by-side

## Technical Notes

### Window Flags
The dialog uses `Qt.Window` flag, which:
- Makes it appear as a separate window in the taskbar
- Allows it to be minimized/maximized independently
- Enables free arrangement on screen
- Does not force it to stay on top (user can control window stacking)

### Memory Management
Dialog references are stored in `space_edit_dialogs` list to prevent premature garbage collection. The reference is removed when the dialog closes via the `finished` signal.

### Signal Flow
```
User clicks Save Changes
    ↓
save_changes() method
    ↓
Validate inputs
    ↓
Save to database
    ↓
Emit space_updated signal
    ↓
ProjectDashboard.on_space_updated()
    ↓
Refresh UI (refresh_spaces, refresh_all_data)
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this feature:
1. Add "Open as Modal" option in preferences for users who prefer old behavior
2. Remember dialog positions between sessions
3. Add keyboard shortcut to toggle between dialog and main window
4. Show indicator in main window when space is being edited
5. Prevent opening multiple dialogs for the same space

## Compatibility

This change is backward compatible and does not require database migrations or changes to existing data structures.
