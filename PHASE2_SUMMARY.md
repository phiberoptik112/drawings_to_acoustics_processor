### Technical Implementation

**New Components:**
- `src/drawing/pdf_viewer.py`: 400+ lines - PDF display and interaction
- `src/drawing/drawing_tools.py`: 350+ lines - Modular drawing tool system
- `src/drawing/drawing_overlay.py`: 450+ lines - Transparent overlay management
- `src/drawing/scale_manager.py`: 200+ lines - Coordinate transformation
- `src/ui/dialogs/scale_dialog.py`: 300+ lines - Scale input interface
- Updated `src/ui/drawing_interface.py`: 500+ lines - Complete drawing interface

**Architecture Enhancements:**
- Signal-based communication between PDF viewer and overlay
- Modular tool system with pluggable drawing tools
- Scale-accurate measurement system with unit conversion
- Element data structures ready for database persistence
- Professional PyQt5 styling and layout management

### User Experience Features

**Professional Interface:**
- Toolbar with emoji icons and tool grouping
- Real-time coordinate display in status bar
- Element summary with formatted measurements
- Context-sensitive tool properties panel

**Scale Accuracy:**
- Multiple calibration methods for different use cases
- Real-time conversion between pixels and real-world units
- Formatted distance and area display (ft/in, m/cm, sf/m²)
- Scale persistence across application sessions

**Drawing Workflow:**
1. Import PDF drawing from project dashboard
2. Set or calibrate scale using known dimensions
3. Use rectangle tool to draw room boundaries
4. Place HVAC components using component tool
5. Connect components with segment tool
6. Measure distances for verification
7. View real-time area and length calculations

### Database Integration

**Enhanced Models:**
- Drawing records store scale information and PDF paths
- Framework ready for storing drawn elements
- Coordinate data persistence for overlay recreation
- Project-level scale defaults and settings

### Phase 2 Deliverables Verification

- Complete PDF viewing with zoom and navigation
- Mouse coordinate mapping and interaction

✅ **Drawing interface with PDF overlay system** 
- Transparent overlay with multiple drawing tools
- Professional interface with tool management

✅ **Rectangle drawing tool for rooms**
- Click-drag rectangle creation
- Real-world area calculation and display

✅ **Scale management and coordinate calculation**
- Multiple scale input methods
- Real-time coordinate transformation system

✅ **Component placement tools (bonus)**
- HVAC component library integration
- Visual component placement and labeling

✅ **Segment drawing tools (bonus)**
- Duct segment drawing between components
- Length calculation and display

## Ready for Phase 3

The foundation is now complete for:
- Room properties dialog with material selection
- Height input and volume calculation  
- Database persistence for drawn elements
- RT60 calculation engine integration

**Next Phase Priority:**
1. Room properties dialog for drawn rectangles
2. Material selection from standard library
3. Volume calculation (area × height)
4. Element persistence to database
5. Basic RT60 calculation preparation

Phase 2 has delivered a professional PDF-based drawing system that exceeds the original scope with advanced scale management and comprehensive tool integration.
