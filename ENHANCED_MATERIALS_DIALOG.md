# Enhanced Space Edit Dialog - Multiple Materials Support

## Overview

The space edit dialog has been enhanced to support multiple materials per surface type and improved search functionality. This provides users with more flexibility in specifying complex acoustic treatments and makes it easier to find and select materials.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Multiple Materials Per Surface Type
- **Before**: Only one material could be selected per surface type (ceiling, wall, floor)
- **After**: Multiple materials can be selected for each surface type
- **Benefit**: More realistic modeling of rooms with mixed materials (e.g., walls with both drywall and acoustic panels)

### 2. Search Functionality
- **Search Bar**: Each surface type has its own search bar for filtering materials
- **Real-time Filtering**: Materials are filtered as you type
- **Search Scope**: Searches both material names and descriptions
- **Category Filtering**: Materials are pre-filtered by surface type (ceiling, wall, floor)
- **Expandable Lists**: Search windows can be expanded for better visibility of large material catalogs
- **Status Feedback**: Shows count of matching materials during search

### 3. Enhanced User Interface
- **Material Lists**: Clear display of selected materials with absorption coefficients
- **Add/Remove Controls**: Easy addition and removal of materials
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate updates to calculations when materials are added/removed
- **Scrollable Interface**: Accommodates longer lists of materials
- **Expandable Search Windows**: Larger viewing area for browsing extensive material catalogs
- **Status Indicators**: Real-time feedback on search results and material counts

### 4. Improved Calculations
- **Average Absorption**: When multiple materials are selected, the system calculates the average absorption coefficient
- **Real-time Updates**: Calculations update immediately when materials are added or removed
- **Enhanced Preview**: More detailed breakdown of materials and their contributions

## Technical Implementation

### New Classes

#### MaterialSearchWidget
- Handles material search and selection
- Filters materials by category and search text
- Emits signals when materials are selected

#### MaterialListWidget
- Manages the list of selected materials
- Provides add/remove functionality
- Maintains the current selection state

### Key Methods

#### get_average_absorption_coefficient()
- Calculates the average absorption coefficient for multiple materials
- Used in RT60 calculations when multiple materials are present

#### Enhanced update_calculations_preview()
- Shows detailed breakdown of selected materials
- Displays individual material contributions
- Provides real-time RT60 calculations

## User Experience Improvements

### Material Selection Workflow
1. **Search**: Type in the search bar to filter materials
2. **Browse**: View filtered materials in the list (use "Expand List" for better visibility)
3. **Monitor**: Check the status indicator for search results count
4. **Select**: Click "Add" or double-click to add materials
5. **Review**: See selected materials in the materials list
6. **Remove**: Select and remove unwanted materials
7. **Calculate**: View real-time updates in the calculations tab
8. **Save**: Use "Save Changes" to update database or "Save and Close" to save and exit

### Visual Feedback
- **Search Results**: Materials are filtered in real-time with count indicators
- **Selection State**: Clear indication of which materials are selected
- **Calculations**: Immediate updates when materials change
- **Validation**: Clear error messages for invalid selections
- **Status Updates**: Real-time feedback on search progress and results

## Backward Compatibility

The enhanced dialog maintains backward compatibility with existing data:
- Existing spaces with single materials are loaded correctly
- The first material of each type is used for database storage (for now)
- Room type presets continue to work as expected

## Future Enhancements

### Database Schema Updates
- Store multiple materials per surface type in separate tables
- Support for material area percentages
- Material layering and composite calculations

### Advanced Features
- Material cost estimation
- Material availability checking
- Custom material creation
- Material performance comparison

## Usage Instructions

### Adding Materials
1. Navigate to the "Surface Materials" tab
2. Use the search bar to find materials
3. Click "Add" or double-click to add materials
4. Repeat for different surface types

### Removing Materials
1. Select a material from the "Selected Materials" list
2. Click "Remove Selected"
3. The material will be removed and calculations updated

### Viewing Calculations
1. Go to the "Calculations" tab
2. View the materials breakdown
3. Check RT60 calculations and absorption totals
4. Compare with target values

## Testing

The enhanced dialog can be tested by:
1. Running the main application: `python src/main.py`
2. Creating or editing a space
3. Using the enhanced materials tab with search and multiple material selection
4. Verifying that materials are properly saved when clicking "Save Changes"

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed Issues
- **Dialog Acceptance Error**: Fixed `'SpaceEditDialog' object has no attribute 'Accepted'` error by using `QDialog.Accepted` instead of `dialog.Accepted`
- **Session Handling**: Improved error handling in save_changes() to prevent UnboundLocalError when database is not initialized
- **Import Issues**: Added missing QDialog import to project_dashboard.py
- **Material Loading**: Fixed issue where saved materials weren't properly loaded when reopening the dialog by implementing material key matching
- **Database Session Issues**: Fixed material persistence by properly refreshing space objects after database commits
- **SQLAlchemy Session Management**: Resolved "Instance not persistent within this Session" error by using proper session management across dialog and main application
- **User Experience**: Added "Save and Close" button for clearer user communication about database operations

### Database Compatibility
- The enhanced dialog maintains backward compatibility with existing single-material spaces
- Multiple materials are supported in the interface but stored as single materials in the database for now
- Material key matching ensures compatibility between database-stored materials and the materials catalog
- Future database schema updates will support storing multiple materials per surface type
