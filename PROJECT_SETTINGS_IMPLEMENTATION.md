## Features Implemented

### Tab 1: General Settings
The General Settings tab provides:

1. **Editable Project Properties**
   - Project Name (required field with validation)
   - Project Description (optional multi-line text)
   - Default Scale (dropdown: 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:400, 1:500, 1:1000)
   - Default Units (dropdown: feet, meters)

2. **Read-Only Project Information**
   - Project Location (file system path - displayed as read-only)

3. **Project Statistics Display**
   Real-time statistics showing:
   - Number of drawings
   - Number of spaces
   - Number of HVAC paths
   - Number of HVAC components
   - Number of drawing sets

### Tab 2: Drawing Sets Management
The Drawing Sets tab provides comprehensive management:

1. **Drawing Sets List**
   - Visual indicators:
     - ðŸŸ¢ Active set indicator
     - Phase type icons (ðŸŸ¦ DD, ðŸŸ¨ SD, ðŸŸ¥ CD, ðŸŸ© Final, âš« Legacy, âšª Other)
   - Shows drawing count per set
   - Color-coded active sets (blue text)

2. **Drawing Set Operations**
   - **Add Drawing Set**: Create new drawing sets with phase type
   - **Edit Set**: Modify name, phase type, description, active status
   - **Remove Set**: Delete drawing sets (with safety confirmation)
   - **Set as Active**: Mark a drawing set as the current working set

3. **Drawing Assignments Display**
   - Table showing all drawings in selected set
   - Columns: Drawing Name, Scale, File Path
   - Auto-updates when selection changes

4. **Inline Dialog Creation**
   - Self-contained add/edit dialogs for drawing sets
   - No external dependencies required
   - Form includes:
     - Name field (required)
     - Phase type dropdown
     - Description text area
     - Active checkbox

## User Experience Features

### Visual Design
- Clean, modern light theme with consistent styling
- Responsive layout with proper spacing
- Tab-based organization for logical grouping
- Color-coded status indicators

### Data Validation
- Required field validation (project name)
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Informative success/error messages
- Prevents invalid data entry

### Data Integrity
- Automatic deactivation of other sets when setting one as active
- Safe removal of drawing sets (unassigns drawings, doesn't delete them)
- Proper database transaction handling with rollback on errors
- Session management to prevent detached instance errors

### Integration
- Seamlessly integrated with Project menu in dashboard
- Automatic UI refresh after changes
- Window title updates to reflect new project name
- Preserves all existing project data

## Technical Details

### Database Operations
- Uses SQLAlchemy ORM for all database interactions
- Proper session management with try/finally blocks
- Eager loading with `selectinload` for related data
- Transaction support with commit/rollback

### Qt Integration
- PySide6 widgets and layouts
- Signal/slot connections for reactive UI
- Modal dialog behavior
- Proper parent-child widget relationships

### Error Handling
- Try/except blocks for all critical operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Database rollback on errors

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing Project Settings
1. Open a project in the Project Dashboard
2. Click "Project" in the menu bar
3. Select "Project Settings"
4. The dialog opens with two tabs

### Editing Project Properties
1. Navigate to "General Settings" tab
2. Modify any fields as needed
3. Click "Save Changes" to apply
4. Click "Cancel" to discard changes

### Managing Drawing Sets
1. Navigate to "Drawing Sets" tab
2. Use buttons to add, edit, or remove sets
3. Click on a set to view its drawings
4. Use "Set as Active" to mark current working set
5. Click "Save Changes" when done

### Adding a Drawing Set
1. Click "Add Drawing Set" button
2. Enter name (required)
3. Select phase type (DD, SD, CD, Final, Legacy, Other)
4. Optionally add description
5. Check "Set as active" if this should be the working set
6. Click "Create"

## Safety Features

1. **Confirmation Dialogs**
   - Warns before removing drawing sets
   - Shows impact of deletion (drawing count)
   - Explains that drawings won't be deleted

2. **Data Preservation**
   - Removing a drawing set unassigns drawings but doesn't delete them
   - Original PDF files are never modified or deleted
   - Project statistics preserved

3. **Validation**
   - Required fields enforced
   - Prevents saving with empty project name
   - Database constraints respected

## Testing

### Manual Testing
Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_project_settings.py
```

### Integration Testing
1. Open the application
2. Create or open a project
3. Access Project â†’ Project Settings
4. Test all functionality:
   - Edit project name and save
   - Change default scale and units
   - Add/edit/remove drawing sets
   - Set active drawing set
   - Cancel and verify no changes applied

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Drawing Assignment**
   - Drag-and-drop to assign drawings to sets
   - Bulk assignment operations
   - Copy drawings between sets

2. **Project Location**
   - Allow changing project location
   - Move database file to new location
   - Update all file paths

3. **Additional Settings**
   - Project templates
   - Default material preferences
   - Calculation preferences
   - Export settings

4. **History/Audit**
   - Track changes to project settings
   - Show modification history
   - Undo/redo for settings changes

5. **Import/Export**
   - Export project settings as template
   - Import settings from another project
   - Share drawing set configurations

## Dependencies

### Required Packages
- PySide6 (Qt framework)
- SQLAlchemy (database ORM)
- Python 3.7+

### Internal Dependencies
- `models.Project`
- `models.drawing_sets.DrawingSet`
- `models.drawing.Drawing`
- `models.Space`
- `models.HVACPath`
- `models.HVACComponent`

## Notes

- The dialog is modal, preventing interaction with dashboard until closed
- All changes are persisted to the database immediately on save
- The dashboard automatically refreshes to show updated data
- Drawing sets were already implemented in the database schema
- This implementation provides the UI layer for managing them

## Conclusion

The Project Settings implementation provides a comprehensive, user-friendly interface for managing project properties and drawing sets. It follows best practices for Qt application development, database management, and user experience design. The implementation is complete, tested, and ready for production use.
