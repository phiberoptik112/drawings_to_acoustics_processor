# Summary: Non-Modal Edit Space Properties Window

## What Changed

The **Edit Space Properties** dialog is now an independent, non-modal window that allows users to interact with other windows while it's open.

## Benefits

✅ **Side-by-side reference viewing** - Open PDF specifications alongside the space editor
✅ **Multi-tasking** - Switch between main app and space editor freely
✅ **Multiple windows** - Edit multiple spaces simultaneously
✅ **Better workflow** - Adjust room treatments while referencing drawings
✅ **Flexible arrangement** - Position windows as needed on your screen

## Files Modified

1. **src/ui/dialogs/space_edit_dialog.py**
   - Removed modal flag (`setModal(False)`)
   - Added `space_updated` signal
   - Signal emitted when changes are saved

2. **src/ui/project_dashboard.py**
   - Changed from `exec()` to `show()` for dialog display
   - Added dialog lifecycle management
   - Auto-refreshes UI when space is saved

## How It Works Now

1. Click "Edit Space" in the Project Dashboard
2. Dialog opens as a separate window (not modal)
3. You can now:
   - Click anywhere in the main window
   - Open other windows (PDFs, documents, etc.)
   - Position the space editor window beside reference materials
   - Continue editing while viewing specifications
4. Click "Save Changes" to save without closing
5. Click "Save and Close" to save and close the window
6. Click "Cancel" to close without saving recent changes

## Testing

Run the test to verify the behavior:
```bash
python test_non_modal_space_dialog.py
```

## Documentation

See `NON_MODAL_SPACE_EDIT_DIALOG.md` for complete technical details.

## No Breaking Changes

This is a UX enhancement only - all existing functionality remains intact. The only difference is the window is no longer modal, giving you more flexibility in your workflow.
