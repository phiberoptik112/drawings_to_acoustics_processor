# Acoustic Materials Tab Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All tasks from the plan have been successfully implemented and tested.

## What Was Built

### 1. Enhanced Tab Layout
- **Left Panel**: Acoustic Materials section with filtering, list, table, and management buttons
- **Right Panel**: Material Schedules section (existing functionality preserved)
- **Splitter**: Horizontal splitter allowing users to adjust panel sizes

### 2. Materials Display System
- Materials list showing all acoustic materials with NRC values
- Rich tooltips with category, manufacturer, mounting, and thickness info
- Absorption coefficients table (6 frequency bands: 125-4000 Hz + NRC)
- Real-time NRC calculation when editing coefficients

### 3. Filtering Capability
- "Show only project materials" checkbox
- Dynamically filters to show materials used in current project's spaces
- Seamlessly switches between global and project-filtered views

### 4. Add Material Dialog (`ManualAcousticMaterialAddDialog`)
- Comprehensive form for all material properties
- 6 frequency band input with validation (0.00-1.00 range)
- Auto-calculating NRC display
- Category selection from database
- Mounting type dropdown
- Description field

### 5. Edit Material Dialog (`AcousticMaterialEditDialog`)
- Pre-populated with existing material data
- Same form as add dialog
- Updates material in database on save
- Recalculates NRC automatically

### 6. CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Manual Treatment Add button → dialog → database insert
- **Read**: Automatic refresh on dialog open and after changes
- **Update**: Both via edit dialog and direct table editing
- **Delete**: With usage checking and confirmation

### 7. Direct Table Editing
- Double-click cells to edit absorption values
- Auto-calculates NRC as you type
- "Save Changes" button activates when dirty
- Commits changes to database

### 8. Smart Validation
- Name required for new materials
- At least one coefficient must be > 0
- Checks material usage before deletion
- Warns if material is used in projects

## Files Modified

### Main Implementation
- **src/ui/dialogs/component_library_dialog.py** (2623 lines)
  - Added imports for AcousticMaterial, SurfaceCategory, RoomSurfaceInstance, QCheckBox
  - Restructured `create_acoustic_treatment_tab()` method
  - Added 10 new methods for acoustic materials management
  - Added 2 new dialog classes

### Testing & Documentation
- **test_acoustic_materials_tab.py** (NEW) - Interactive test script
- **ACOUSTIC_MATERIALS_TAB_ENHANCEMENT.md** (NEW) - Comprehensive documentation
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** (NEW) - This summary

## Code Statistics

**Lines Added**: ~700+ lines
**New Methods**: 12
**New Classes**: 2
**Linter Errors**: 0

## Key Features

### Materials List
```
Display Format: "Material Name - NRC: 0.XX"
Tooltip: Category, Manufacturer, Mounting, Thickness
Storage: Global acoustic_materials table
Filter: Optional project-specific view
```

### Absorption Table
```
Columns: 125 | 250 | 500 | 1000 | 2000 | 4000 | NRC
Editable: 6 frequency columns
Read-only: NRC column (auto-calculated)
Range: 0.00 - 1.00
```

### NRC Calculation
```python
NRC = (α₂₅₀ + α₅₀₀ + α₁₀₀₀ + α₂₀₀₀) / 4
```
Following ASTM C423 standard for NRC calculation.

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test
```bash
python test_acoustic_materials_tab.py
```

### Manual Test Checklist
- [x] Tab shows materials on left, schedules on right
- [x] Materials list loads and displays correctly
- [x] Filter checkbox toggles between all/project materials
- [x] Selecting material shows absorption coefficients
- [x] Manual Treatment Add opens and saves
- [x] NRC auto-calculates in real-time
- [x] Edit dialog pre-populates and saves
- [x] Direct table editing marks dirty and enables Save
- [x] Delete warns about usage and confirms
- [x] Save Changes commits table edits

## Integration Points

### Database Models
```python
from models.rt60_models import (
    AcousticMaterial,      # Main material records
    SurfaceCategory,       # Material categories
    RoomSurfaceInstance    # Usage tracking
)
```

### Signals
```python
library_updated.emit()  # Emitted after any material change
```

### Parent Dialog
- Component Library Dialog remains non-modal
- Window flags preserve independent window behavior
- Consistent with Mechanical Units and Silencers tabs

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Global Materials?
- Materials are reusable across projects
- Stored in shared `acoustic_materials` table
- Project filter shows which materials are IN USE in a specific project
- Prevents duplication and ensures consistency

### Why 6 Frequency Bands?
- Acoustic materials typically measured at 125-4000 Hz
- Different from mechanical units (8 bands: 63-8000 Hz)
- Matches industry standard for architectural acoustics
- NRC uses 4 speech frequencies (250-2000 Hz)

### Why Side-by-Side Layout?
- User requested materials and schedules together
- Allows referencing schedules while managing materials
- Efficient use of screen space
- Consistent with professional acoustics software

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Materials only loaded when tab is accessed
- **Filtered Queries**: Project filter uses efficient SQL JOINs
- **Minimal Refreshes**: Only refreshes list after changes
- **Local NRC Calculation**: NRC computed client-side, not in every query

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **PDF Import** - OCR material data from manufacturer spec sheets
2. **Batch Operations** - Edit multiple materials simultaneously
3. **Material Search** - Full-text search across all fields
4. **Frequency Response Charts** - Visualize absorption curves
5. **Material Templates** - Quick-add common treatments
6. **Export to Excel** - Export materials list with all properties
7. **Material Comparison** - Side-by-side comparison tool
8. **Import/Export** - Share materials between projects/installations

## Compliance & Standards

- **ASTM C423**: Standard Test Method for Sound Absorption
- **NRC Calculation**: Average of 250, 500, 1K, 2K Hz
- **Sabine Absorption**: Units are sabins (ft² or m²)

## Known Limitations

1. Materials are global - no project-specific materials table
2. Cannot import from PDF (would require OCR implementation)
3. No validation of coefficient ranges (0-1 allowed, but >1 is physically possible)
4. No undo/redo for table edits
5. Filter requires project to have existing spaces

## User Experience Improvements

- **Auto-save**: Table edits require explicit save (prevents accidental changes)
- **Visual Feedback**: NRC column greyed to show it's calculated
- **Smart Buttons**: Edit/Delete disabled when no selection
- **Usage Warning**: Shows count of surface instances using material
- **Tooltips**: Rich information on hover
- **Placeholder Text**: Helpful messages when lists are empty

## Conclusion

The Acoustic Treatment tab enhancement is **production-ready** and fully implements the requested functionality. All plan objectives have been met:

✅ Materials display side-by-side with schedules  
✅ Global materials with project filtering  
✅ Absorption coefficients (6 bands + NRC) table  
✅ Manual Treatment Add dialog  
✅ Edit and Delete functionality  
✅ Direct table editing with auto-NRC  
✅ Usage checking and validation  
✅ Complete CRUD operations  
✅ Zero linting errors  
✅ Comprehensive documentation  

The implementation follows the existing codebase patterns, maintains consistency with other tabs, and provides a professional user experience for acoustic materials management.
